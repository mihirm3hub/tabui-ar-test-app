# TabUI: Location Track AR

This Project is built using Vanilla Js, Three.Js, A-frame and 8thwall AR libraries. It utilizes Niantic Lightship Map
module to map location tabs based on user co-ordinates.
You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.
